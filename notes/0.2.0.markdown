scala-uuid 0.2.0 is out with more optimized goodness!

### Breaking changes:
* The primary constructor `UUID(_: String)` now requires a strict, 36 character UUID in `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` format
* Removed long tuple factory / accessor
* Removed "useless" string extractor

### Other changes:
* Added optimized primitive constructors and array factories (`long`, `int`, `short`, `byte`, `char`)
* Inlined static forwarders and utility methods
* `StaticUUID` is now a class, extended by the `StaticUUID` object
* Added ScalaDoc for all methods, linked to GitHub sources
* Now, and forever running with 100% test coverage!
